# Changelog

Released only when the card changes, on the version of the [PowerEngine app](https://github.com/durkimat/ha-powerengine-controller)
it ships with (one sequence, so card versions can skip numbers). Older entries below were kept in step with the app.

## 0.9.135

### Behaviour changes

- **"Re-plan now" under the expected timeline** (needs app 0.9.135): asks the app to re-plan, then says "Re-planning..." and "Re-planned at HH:MM" when the new plan arrives, or says so when nothing came back within 20 seconds.
- **The value map's buy line uses the price the plan worked with for a smart slot that is only a chance** (the chance of the offered price plus the rest at the standard rate), now that the timeline draws such a slot at the offered price. Before, the buy line and the plan could disagree about whether a charge was worth it.

## 0.9.131

### Behaviour changes

None. This release is for the card only: nothing about planning, control or the app's sensors changes.
- **The plan chart now opens an hour before "now" and stays where you put it on a phone.** Inside Home Assistant the chart was positioned before it had a width, so it opened at the start of the 18 hours of history, and every update (several sensors change together) sent it back there while you were sliding. It now waits until it has a width before positioning, and ignores the old chart being swapped out.

## 0.9.130

- **The plan chart now opens an hour before "now" every time.** In 0.9.128 it could open at the start of the 18 hours instead, when the card was built before it was on screen (for example a dashboard view you had not opened yet). It now opens in the right place and keeps your place when you scroll.

## 0.9.128

- The engine card's **plan chart now opens one hour before "now"**, so the now line sits near the left edge. The rest of the last 18 hours is still a scroll to the left.
- **On a phone the chart no longer jumps back while you scroll it.** A redraw (a sensor update, or the once-a-minute clock) that arrives while your finger is on the chart now waits until you let go, and your place is kept.
- The chart's hover text now survives every redraw, a card on a hidden dashboard view catches up when you return to it, and the leftmost hour label is no longer clipped.

## 0.9.126

- The engine card's **plan chart now shows the last 18 hours** as they ran (modes, battery level, import price), shaded left of "now", and scrolls back over them. It needs app 0.9.126 for the history; with an older app the chart looks as before.
- **"Now" on the plan chart follows the clock.** It used to stay where the plan was last worked out, because the chart only redrew when the plan changed. It now redraws about once a minute while on screen, without losing your scroll position.

## 0.9.120

- New **Stop the car charger during grid events** switch on the Config page, under Grid events (on by default). It needs app 0.9.120, so the card now asks for that version or newer.

## 0.9.118

### Changed

- **The expected-timeline hover text is now a box under the chart**, like the value map's, which reads better on a phone. Move
  over the chart, or tap it, and a guide line marks the time while the box shows the mode and what ends it, the battery
  level (with its likely range), the import price, the sun forecast and the house use expected.

### Fixed

- **The sun and house strip no longer vanishes when no sun is expected.** When the plan's window has no sun in it (for
  example in the evening, before sunrise), the whole strip was left out. It now stays with the house line, and the legend says
  no sun is expected in this window.

## 0.9.117

### New

- **Hover text on the Engine v2 expected timeline.** Move the pointer over the chart (or tap it on a phone) to see a guide
  line and a small box with what the plan says at that time: the mode and whether it happened or is expected, what ends it
  and why, the battery level (with the likely range for the future), the import price (and whether it is a smart slot that
  may not come, a grid event or free power), the sun forecast and the house use expected. It shows the values and status
  that do not fit inside the bars.

### Fixed

- **Engine v2 lists now run newest first, then older as you scroll down.** "Mode changes" on the history card was oldest
  first. "Latest" on the Engine v2 today card showed the oldest of the recent entries instead of the newest (it reversed a
  list the app already sends newest first); it now shows up to 30, newest at the top, in a scrolling box.

## 0.9.115

### New

- **The Engine v2 expected-timeline chart shows the sun forecast.** A strip along the bottom of the chart shows the sun
  the plan expects (shaded from the low to the high forecast, with the middle line) and the house use expected, so you
  can see where spare sun is meant to go. The legend gives the strip's scale. Needs app 0.9.115; with an older app the
  chart looks as before.

## 0.9.113

### Behaviour changes

- None.

### Fixes

- **The engine badge sizes itself to its text.** On a phone its line wraps, and the card below covered it.

## 0.9.112

### Behaviour changes

- None.

### Fixes

- **The engine tab icons show their 1 and 2.** The digit was cut out with a drawing rule Home Assistant's icons don't use, so
  both tabs showed the same plain engine. The digits are now drawn so they cut out the way Home Assistant draws icons.

## 0.9.111

### Behaviour changes

- **Saving waits longer for PowerEngine's answer** (45 seconds, was 15), and if none comes it says the change may still go
  through and to refresh in a minute, instead of reporting an error. A late answer still replaces the message.

### Fixes

- **Engine tab icons now draw.** Home Assistant draws the dashboard's tabs before the card file has loaded, so the engine icons
  were treated as unknown and left blank for good. Once the card has registered them it now has Home Assistant look them up again.

## 0.9.110

### Behaviour changes

- **Engine icons and badges:** the two engine pages get an engine icon with 1 or 2 on it, and a badge saying whether that engine is
  Active, Paused or Passive.

### New

- **Engine v2 history card** with a day picker (level as run against expected, modes, prices, value of a stored kWh, mode changes).
- **Engines compared, same day** card for the Costs page: savings of engine v1, engine v2 and the best possible for the last 7 days,
  the better engine marked, the difference, which engine was in control, totals and the calibration line.
- The setting "Engine comparison (Costs page)" on the Config page.

## 0.9.109

### Behaviour changes

- When PowerEngine updates its own Home Assistant package, the Configuration and Update cards show "PowerEngine has updated its Home Assistant package." An administrator presses **Load PowerEngine's Home Assistant changes** to load it without restarting Home Assistant; other users are asked to get an administrator to do it.
- After you change "Other battery controller" and save, the same banner appears straight away.
- If PowerEngine can't manage its Home Assistant package (no packages folder, a package set up by hand, or an error), the Configuration page and setup checklist show a short explanation with a link to the install guide.
- Needs PowerEngine 0.9.109 or later for the banner; with an older app nothing changes.

## 0.9.108

### Behaviour changes

- **Predbat is now optional on the dashboard.** The Battery controller handover card (the Predbat and PowerEngine switch) only appears when Predbat is set as the other battery controller (with an older app: only when Predbat's own entities exist in Home Assistant). Everyone else sees nothing in its place.
- **Config page, Inverter control:** a new choice, **Other battery controller** (none, Predbat or another controller). Until you save a choice it shows the one PowerEngine is using, worked out from your guards. The three guard entities show only when Predbat or another controller is chosen, and they no longer count as "needed to go live" otherwise. If nothing is chosen and no guard is mapped, a prompt (and the setup checklist) asks you to choose, because PowerEngine won't go Active until you do.
- The handover card no longer checks or lists a built-in set of personal charge and discharge automations.
- The Tests page's first step mentions Predbat only when Predbat is in use.

## 0.9.107

### Behaviour changes

- **The Engine v2 page shows engine v2's preview while engine v1 is in control.** The three engine v2 cards (Monitoring, plan and health) now show the data with a line at the top, "Preview: engine v1 is in control. Nothing is sent.", and the Monitoring card says "Would be charging ..." instead of the live mode. The old "Engine v2 is not running (engine v1 is)" shows only when there is nothing to preview (an app older than 0.9.107, or the preview switched off). The new setting appears on the config page by itself.

## 0.9.106

### Behaviour changes

- **Config page: an engine choice at the top** (engine v1 or engine v2, with a confirmation either way), and the settings in
  three groups: Your house, Engine v1 settings and Engine v2 settings. The engine not in use is dimmed but stays editable.
  With an app older than 0.9.106 nothing changes.

### New

- Three cards for engine v2: what it is doing now and what ends it (with the value of a stored kWh against today's prices),
  the expected timeline and value map, and its health.
- The new shared setting "Battery's hard floor" in the battery section.

## 0.9.105

- The Config page's *Tariff and planning* section has the new **Overnight window** choice (Learned or Fixed times) and the two fixed times, with a line showing the window in use and the one learned from the rates (needs app 0.9.105; an older app has no such settings or line, so nothing shows).

## 0.9.104

- New setting **Shortest real charge** and tick box **Learn: shortest real charge** in the car section of the Config page (needs app 0.9.104; an older app does not list them, so nothing shows).
- The car section is now titled "Car and smart charging" (it carried the supplier's name).
- Removing the car charger in Your system also switches off the new learning tick box.

## 0.9.100

- New **Report a problem** section in the diagnostics card on the Health tab. Type a title and a short description and press **Prepare report**: the card collects the diagnostics and replaces account, meter and serial numbers, site and device ids, emails and postcodes with placeholders. You can read exactly what will be sent. **Download and open GitHub issue** saves the file and opens a pre-filled GitHub issue (you need a GitHub account); drag the file onto the issue's Diagnostics box and submit.
- The ordinary diagnostics export is unchanged.

## 0.9.97

- New **Override** card at the top of the Monitoring page: shows what the inverter is doing and lets an admin switch it to Self-use, Hold, Charge or Export for a plan window, a number of half-hours, until a time, or permanently, with a Cancel button while one is on. It hides itself on an app without the override.
- The dashboard's "Mode" tile is renamed **Power Engine**. Needs card 0.9.97 (the dashboard now names the new card).

## 0.9.95

### Your system

- **New "Your system" card replaces the Setup wizard** (`custom:powerengine-system-card`; the old `powerengine-wizard-card` name still works). The list of equipment is read only. **Change your system** opens a panel to add, edit, replace and remove equipment: pick what it is, find it in Home Assistant, choose its entities (with live values, a sign check and an Invert tick), review.
- Changes are a draft until **Apply to System**. **Save draft** keeps it in this browser; closing with unsaved edits asks Save draft, Discard changes or Keep editing. Apply sends only the equipment changes.
- Removing an optional part, an extra solar plant or another device shows what goes with it first. The inverter and the tariff can only be replaced.
- The configuration card no longer edits the inverter, tariff, solar plants or other devices; use Your system. It follows the saved equipment after an Apply, so its own Save never writes old equipment back.
- Needs PowerEngine app 0.9.95 for the dashboard that names the new card; the card itself works with the same apps as before.

## 0.9.93

### Other devices

- **Your system now has an "Other devices" list** (with PowerEngine app 0.9.93 or newer; older apps don't show it). Add a device, pick which of its battery level, battery power and solar power sensors to use, and see what PowerEngine reads from it. Devices are read only: nothing is controlled but the inverter chosen above.
- Devices you already have in Home Assistant that PowerEngine doesn't use, other than solar-only ones, are now described as "could be added as a read-only device below" instead of "not supported yet" when the app supports it.

## 0.9.89

### Setup wizard and Config page

- The Setup wizard is folded away on a system that is already set up, and starts open on a new one.
- It reads what PowerEngine already uses for each part and keeps that chosen (EDF stays chosen if the Octopus integration is also installed). Other devices Home Assistant has for a part are listed as "also found, not used".
- **Solar plants:** shows the plants you already have, offers other solar-looking devices (a second solar inverter, plug-in panels) to add as read-only plants with their power and energy-today guessed, and lets you add or remove one without touching the other parts. A hybrid inverter with a battery that has no support yet is listed as "not supported yet", with the entity-list export.
- **Your system** lists the solar plants it counts and those devices too, and its labels match the wizard (Car charger, Electricity tariff, Solar forecast, Grid events).
- The setup checklist card hides itself when everything is in place.
- Wording: the grid events switch, section and notification are named "Grid events" instead of after the provider.

## 0.9.88

### Setup wizard

- New **Setup wizard** card (`custom:powerengine-wizard-card`). It lists what a home needs (required and optional parts, found or not found in Home Assistant, with install links), lets you pick each device, fills PowerEngine's inputs from that device's own entities with live values, checks battery and grid signs against what you see (with one-click Invert) and that house load adds up, and saves a Passive setup. Parts you don't have can be skipped; on an already configured system you can change one part at a time.
- **Candidate entities export** for hardware PowerEngine doesn't support yet: download or copy a scrubbed list of a device's entities (units, options, limits, firmware) to send with a support request.
- The card hides the wizard when the app is too old to tell it what to look for.

## 0.9.86

- Plan history day picker card (`powerengine-history-date-card`): a date box with previous/next day arrows, used by the dashboard's Plan history page. It hides itself on an older app.

## 0.9.84

- New Plan history date picker card, used by the dashboard's Plan history page. It hides itself on an older app.

## 0.9.82

- The Tests page no longer shows "Configuration error". (It broke in 0.9.71.)

## 0.9.77

- Configuration page: the new "Inverter max output" setting appears under Inverter control.
- Update card: a **Check for updates** button (admins) asks HACS to look for new releases, and the Update button stays disabled until an update is known.
- Setup checklist: the "Check again" button is gone (the checks run on load and after an install).

## 0.9.75

- The savings chart's **Custom** button is gone, along with the date-range line under the chart. The other buttons (Yesterday, Last 7 days, This month, Last 30 days) work as before.
- The card works with app 0.9.69 or newer again.

## 0.9.74

- The savings chart has a new Custom button, shown when the app offers a chosen date range. It brings back the range you picked with From and To, so you can switch away and return to it.
- The chart's caption shows the dates of the chosen range and how many days it covers, with a short note if some of the days asked for had no costs recorded.
- The card now asks for app 0.9.72 or newer (the version that added the date range).

## 0.9.71

- Checks versions against a minimum instead of requiring an exact match: this card needs app 0.9.69 or later, and it
  warns on the update and health cards if the app is older, or if the app asks for a newer card. From now on the card
  is released only when it changes.

## 0.9.70

- The demo card reloads the page once after a demo start, day change or exit, so the demo's dashboard shows without a manual refresh.

## 0.9.69

- The demo welcome card uses the demo's own day titles (the same as the banner). Health says "Not set up yet" before setup. true/false settings that arrive as text are read as booleans in the config form.

## 0.9.68

- No card changes; version kept in step.

## 0.9.67

- No card changes; version kept in step.

## 0.9.66

- New **Your system** block at the top of the configuration card: choose the inverter (and its firmware), car charger, car, tariff, forecast and grid events, with each option's test status. It warns before an inverter change switches PowerEngine to Passive, and shows a banner until the supervised tests are run again. It is hidden with an older app.

## 0.9.65

- No card changes; version kept in step.

## 0.9.64

- No card changes; version kept in step.

## 0.9.63

- New `powerengine-demo-card`: a welcome card with a day picker on an unconfigured PowerEngine, and a demo banner with day switching and exit. It hides itself on a set-up system. The setup card gains a "Try the demo" link.

## 0.9.62

- New `powerengine-setup-card`: checks HACS (and its AppDaemon option), the AppDaemon add-on, the PowerEngine app, the chart cards and MQTT, with HACS install buttons for admins. Available in the card picker as "PowerEngine setup".

## 0.9.61

- Supplier and device names on the Config page come from PowerEngine (identical text for EDF/Zappi/Solcast/Solis).

## 0.9.60

- Config page: smart-charge request options (requests per day, time between requests, look-ahead, whole-house slots, skip when the car is full) in the car and smart-charge section.

## 0.9.53

- Waterfall card drawn as columns cascading left to right (short labels and rounded values on narrow screens).

## 0.9.52

- New `powerengine-waterfall-card` (Costs page): where the savings came from, per period, drawn as rows that stay readable on a phone.

## 0.9.51

## 0.8.4

- No card changes; version kept in step with the app.

## 0.8.3

- No card changes; version kept in step with the app (automatic AppDaemon restart after updates).

## 0.8.2

- **Config page reorganised by topic.** One section per topic (Battery, Grid and house, Solar, Tariff and planning,
  Car and EDF smart charge, Selling, Axle, Free power, Cold battery, Inverter control, Tariff simulator,
  Notifications), each holding its switches, inputs, settings and learning. Anything new that isn't placed yet
  appears under *Other*.
- **Search** (names, descriptions and entity IDs) and filters: *All*, *Needs attention*, *Required*, *Optional*.
- **Colour:** green strip for a working required input, red for one missing or failing, amber for one needed
  only for something not in use (going live, or a switched-off feature), grey for optional. Section headers count
  required and optional inputs; a line at the top says how many required inputs need attention and jumps to the
  first.
- Inverter window, current, storage-mode and apply entities show as *Needed to go live* (required once live).
- Switched-off topics (Axle, Free power, Cold battery, Simulator) are greyed out with a note.
- Fix: new features (learning, cold caution) showed unticked on configs saved before 0.8.0.

## 0.8.1

- Features: four *Learn: …* switches replace *Use learned limits*.
- Settings: choice settings (a drop-down) shown in their section; *Battery location* under *Cold battery*.
- Fills in a role's `required` as "yes" when the app leaves it out.

## 0.8.0

- Features: *Use learned limits*, *Cold battery caution*, *Learn cold behaviour*. Settings: new *Cold battery* section.
- *Use measured* boxes on *Max charge power* and *Max discharge power*, showing the learned rate.

## 0.7.7

- No card changes; version kept in step with the app.

## 0.7.6

- No card changes; version kept in step with the app (phone-friendly charts in the dashboard).

## 0.7.5

- Handover panel: an entity it can't read makes the status *not fully live* (with a note) instead of *live*.

## 0.7.4

- Handover card: status line (live / paused for testing / not fully live), *Pause for testing* and *Resume (go live)*
  while PowerEngine is selected; PowerEngine mode should be *passive* under Predbat and *active* under PowerEngine;
  a pause while PowerEngine is selected is shown as testing, not as a fault.

## 0.7.3

- New `custom:powerengine-handover-card`: switch battery control between Predbat and PowerEngine through
  `input_select.battery_controller` (the app's handover package), with a confirm step, progress, a should-be/is table
  and *Re-apply*. Options: `title`, `selector`, `read_only`, `pause`, `mode`, `scripts`, `legacy`.
